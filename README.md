## DataSets

Dataset - The Chicago Building Energy Use Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually.</div>

  | Community Area     | String  | The Chicago community area where the property is located
  | Primary Property Type           | String     | The primary use of a property (e.g. office, retail store)
  | Gross Floor Are - Buildings (sq ft) | Int  | Total interior floor space in square feet between the outside surfaces of a building’s enclosing walls
  | Year Built | Int | Year in which a property was constructed or underwent a complete renovation
  | # of Buildings         | Int | Number of buildings included in the property's report
  | Water Use (kGal)      | Int | Water use for the data year in thousands of gallons from 2018 and on
  | ENERGY STAR Score       | Int     | 1-100 rating that assesses a property’s overall energy performance, based on national data to control for differences among climate, building uses, and operations 
  | Electricity Use (kBtu)              | Int  | The annual amount of electricity consumed by the property on-site            
  | Natural Gas Use (kBtu)   | Int  | The annual amount of utility-supplied natural gas consumed by the property
  | District Steam Use (kBtu)| Int     | The annual amount of district steam consumed by the property on-site
  | District Chilled Water Use (kBtu)         | Int  | The annual amount of district chilled water consumed by the property on-site
  | All Other Fuel Use (kBtu)        | Int  | The annual amount of fuel use other than electricity, natural gas, district chilled water, or district steam consumed by the property on-site
  | Site EUI (kBtu/sq ft)       | Int     | Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's Site Energy Use divided by its gross floor area. Site Energy Use is the annual amount of all the energy consumed by the property on-site, as reported on utility bills. 
  | Source EUI (kBtu/sq ft)              | Int  | Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's Source Energy Use divided by its gross floor area. Source Energy Use is the annual energy used to operate the property, including losses from generation, transmission, & distribution           
  | Weather Normalized Site EUI (kBtu/sq ft)   | Int  | Weather Normalized (WN) Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's WN Site Energy divided by its gross floor area (in square feet). WN Site Energy is the Site Energy Use the property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions
  | Weather Normalized Source EUI (kBtu/sq ft)| Int     | Weather Normalized (WN) Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's WN Source Energy divided by its gross floor area. WN Source Energy is the Source Energy Use the property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions
  | Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)        | Int  | The total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide gases released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption at the property, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
  | GHG Intensity (kg CO2e/sq ft)        | Int  | Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions divided by property's gross floor area, measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot
  | Latitude        | Float  | Latitude 
  | Longitude       | Float  | Longitude
  | Location        | String | Latitude and Longitude in dictionary format
  | Row_ID        | String | A unique ID for the row, made up of the combination of the Data Year and ID


## Clean Up

- We queried the number of rows in the dataset to ensure we had greater than 100 unique records. The original dataset contains 17728 unique records.
- We dropped all rows that were 'Exempt' for their 'Reporting Status' as these buildings did not submit any reports to be included in the data set. 
- We renamed the 'ID' column to 'Building ID' to further differentiate from 'Row_ID' which is unique for each row. 'Building ID' is unique to each building, meaning there are duplicates in this column. 
- Identified rows containing null values, and filled in with 'NaN' in order to appropraitely upload our data to our SQL database.
- We grouped our data by building in unique 'Community Areas' in order to compare energy usage amongst Chciagos neighborhoods.
- In order to upload our data set into a SQL Database, we needed to rename all original columns to include all lower case letters and replace spaces with underscores.


## Load

- We created a SQL database, in PostgreSQL, called 'Chicago_Energy_Benchmarking.SQL' and within this we created a table to store our CSV file.
- We set 'row_id' as our primary key. 
- Using PgAdmin, we imported our Clean_data.csv into our chicago_energy_benchmarking table. 
- Finally, we commited our changes and closed the session. 

## Analyses and Visualizations
- We read in our json file using the D3 Library
- Using JavaScript and HTML, we created a dashboard fit with a dropdown element and vizualizations.
- We included a map of each building that filed and energy report in Chicago for each year between 2015-2019. The map indicated which neighborhoods use the greatest amount of energy, as well details about individual building energy ratings. 
- Using the dropdown, site visitors have the ability to select any building that has filed a report and see a line graph charting electricty usage, natural gas usage, and total GHG emissions. Theres is also a gauge vizualizations that charts that building's average Chicago Energy Score from 2018-2020.
